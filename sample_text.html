<h2>Visa information for India</h2>

<h3>India Tourist eVisa</h3>
<p>This tourist visa allows travelers from eligible countries to enter India for tourism purposes. You can get the visa entirely online, without ever stepping into an Indian embassy because the visa is electronically linked to your passport.</p>
<p>You can decide which visa suits your travel needs. We have three options: 30-day eVisa India, 1-year eVisa India, and 5-year eVisa India.</p>
<p>The 1-year visa and the 5-year visa allow for <span class="font-bold">180 days Per Entry</span> as long as the visa remains valid.</p>

<h2>Transport and ways to travel around India</h2>

<h2>Safety in India</h2>
<p>Petty crime is quite common in India, especially in major cities. However, don’t let this deter you from enjoying this wonderful country. There are a few tips you can follow to stay safe in India:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep your personal belongings close to you and wear any backpacks or purses on your front, especially in crowded areas like markets and terminals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't accept drinks or food from strangers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid buying from street vendors that approach you. If you want to get souvenirs from your trip, visit local markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask for tips and assistance from your host or receptionist at your hotel and hostel. They will give you specific instructions on what to do and avoid during your trip.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If exploring the many mountains and peaks in India, make sure to hire a guide to have the safest experience. Avoid restricted or protected areas and monitor local media to stay updated regarding any alerts. Also bear in mind, that commercial mountain rescue services are available only up to altitudes of 3,000 meters. </p>
<p>In general, during your trip make sure you are familiar with local laws and have the necessary information in case you require emergency assistance like emergency numbers to contact the Indian authorities and your local embassy or consulate contact information.</p>
<h2>Weather in India</h2>
<p>India has only two seasons, the dry season and the monsoon season. But regardless of the season, it is a predominantly hot country. During the dry season, from mid-October to mid-May, temperatures range between 14°C/57°F and 34°C/93°F. December and January are the cooler months. We recommend visiting this time of the year, especially if you plan to travel around south India.</p>
<p>The monsoon season occurs between mid-May and mid-October. It’s not recommended to visit India during monsoon season. Heavy rain, suffocating heat, and humidity can make your experience uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Regardless of the time of the year you visit India, we recommend that you bring fresh clothing. Avoid tank tops, translucid garments, and shorts. India is a conservative country and you might be denied entry to many attractions because of what you’re wearing.</p>
